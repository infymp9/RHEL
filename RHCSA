Note : Before doing the following Tasks in our Lab

Create three primary partitions [2 Physical (1 GB Each) and 1 Swap (500 MB) and then mount persistently]


Task 14:

Add the SWAP Space with a size of 754 MiB

Sol:

#lsblk

(You Can Find … /dev/sda (or) /dev/vda , In our Lab: /dev/vdb)

(Use only Device Name , don’t use partition name while typing fdisk)

#fdisk /dev/vdb

p

n

:first sector ...enter

:second sector  +754M

:t

:82

:w ..... to save changes

#partprobe /dev/vdb

#lsblk

(Identify newly created partition with 754MB…Identify “X”. Partition Name is important)
 

#mkswap /dev/vdbX                ---> Make the swap on newly created Partition
 
#swapon /dev/vdbX                ---> To enable SWAP
 
#blkid

Copy UUID from the Result

#vim /etc/fstab

PasteUUID   swap  swap  defaults 0 0 

:wq
 

#swapon -a         (To Activate SWAP from fstab entries)

To Verify:

#free -m (or) #swapon -s


Task 15:

Create a Logical Volume with the name share by using 100 Extents. From the volume group sharegroup of 8MiB extent size. And mount it under /mnt/share with ext3 File system. Sol:


First Determine the Size : Calculate from cli

#bc	(Press Enter)

100*8 (Press Enter)

800

(800 MB, while creating add + 8 MB for Exact Size, Note : You can add +4 MB or +8 MB or +16 MB or +32 MB based on Extent Size))

Quit


#lsblk

Step 1: Create Partition and change type to LVM (8e)


#fdisk /dev/vdb

p

n

:first sector ...enter

:second sector +808M

:t

:8e

:w ..... to save changes


#partprobe /dev/vdb

#lsblk	(Identify Newly created partition with 804MB)


Step 2: Create LVM with the Name share


#pvcreate /dev/vdbX


#vgcreate sharegroup -s 8M /dev/vdbX

(Note: Bydefault Physical Extent Size i.e PE is 4 MB )

To Check:

#vgdisplay sharegroup


#lvcreate -n share -l 100 sharegroup

(Note:In Question, Number Extents required 100)

(Note: small l represent size in extents and Capital L represent size in MB)(Should be very careful)


. To Check: #lvdisplay /dev/sharegroup/share (To check Size and info)


Step 3: Write File System based on the Objective


#mkfs.ext3 /dev/sharegroup/share

#blkid

Create Directory to mount on it:


#mkdir /mnt/share

#blkid

Copy UUID from the Result

#vim /etc/fstab
 

PasteUUID  /mnt/share ext3 defaults  0 0

:wq

#mount -a
 

To Check:

#df -hT


Task 16:

Create a Logical volume vo with 250MB from a volume group myvol of 1000MB size.

Mount it under /mnt/myvolume with ext4 file system persistently.

#lsblk

#fdisk /dev/vdb

p

n

:first sector ...enter

:second sector +1004M	(VG Fixed with 1000MB,so we have to use +4MB because default Extent Size)

:t

:8e

:w ..... to save changes

#partprobe /dev/vdb

Check Newly created partition using #lsblk


Note: Don’t Format the Partition because it is for Logical Volume

#pvcreate /dev/vdbX

#pvs

#vgcreate myvol /dev/vdbX	(Default Extent Size is 4 MB)


#vgs  or vgdisplay myvol

#lvcreate -n vo -L 250M myvol

#lvs or lvdisplay  /dev/myvol/vo

#mkfs.ext4  /dev/myvol/vo

#mkdir  /mnt/myvolume

#blkid

Copy UUID from the Result

#vim /etc/fstab

PasteUUID  /mnt/myvolume	ext4  defaults  0  0

:wq

#mount -a

#df -hT
